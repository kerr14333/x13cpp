# X13cpp — Claude working notes

A **faithful C++17 port of the U.S. Census Bureau's X-13ARIMA-SEATS** (v1.1 b61),
packaged as embeddable **R** (Rcpp) and **Python** (pybind11) libraries over one
shared `core/`. It is a proof-of-concept under active development.

## Project vision & priority order

The endgame, in sequence:
1. **Convert Census X-13 Fortran → C++** (the `core/` engine). **This is the first
   and foremost priority — everything else needs it first.** Bit-exact with the
   oracle (see next section). This is where day-to-day work lives.
2. **R + Python wrappers as IMPORTED LIBRARIES** — `library(x13)` / `import x13`,
   called in-process to run X-13 and get **result objects** back. NOT a thin shell
   around an executable; the point is working with X-13 directly in the interpreter.
3. **Nice interfaces + all kinds of plots** built on those result objects.
4. **Far future:** tooling to review a large number of series at once.

Once the conversion is complete, the fork is either (a) refactor the C++ to be more
modern, or (b) start the R/Python interfaces — decide then.

Keep #1 the focus. #2-#4 are the reason for #1, but the engine must exist and match
Census before they mean anything. Don't rabbit-hole a single parity xfail at the
expense of overall engine progress — but the engine port is the job.

## The one rule: bit parity

The contract is **bit-exact agreement (1e-8) with the vendored Fortran oracle**
`oracle/fortran/x13as_ascii_O2.exe`. Port faithfully — **do not "improve" the
Fortran.**
- **Ported bugs stay bugs.** Reproduce Census defects verbatim, comment them, and
  log each as a `CB-N` entry in `tools/census_bugs.md` pinned to a test.
- **No auto file output** in the final package: results live on the result object;
  writing `.udg`/`.fct`/save files is explicit and caller-driven.
- Packaging must pass **CRAN + PyPI** checks — design wrappers compliant from the
  start.

## Use the project skills (`.claude/skills/`)

These carry the conventions that otherwise waste turns — read/use them, don't
improvise:
- **`build-run`** — how to build & run tests on this machine.
- **`parity-gate`** — add a corpus spec, bless its oracle golden, gate bit-exact.
- **`port-leaf`** — transcribe one Fortran subroutine with the farray / indexing /
  `DATA` / ported-bug conventions.

## Build & test (Windows) — essentials

- **Build via the PowerShell tool:** `& tools/build.ps1` (configures, builds, runs
  the CTest unit suite). Do **not** run it as `powershell -File …` (execution
  policy blocks `-File`).
- **Toolchain: rtools44** (`C:\rtools44\x86_64-w64-mingw32.static.posix\bin`).
  `build.ps1` prepends that bin to PATH — required, or the collect2→ld LTO-plugin
  link aborts with **"ld returned 9"** (rtools40 shadowing rtools44 on PATH is the
  classic cause). Drive compilers from PowerShell, not msys/Bash (msys make/xargs
  scrub `TEMP` and break gfortran).
- **Python is `python`** (3.14). `python3` is a Windows App alias → "Permission
  denied".
- **Parity tests:** `python -m pytest tests/parity -q`. Green = `NNN passed`, with
  expected `s` skips (parse-gap specs) and `x` xfails (unported features).
- After adding a `core/src/*.cpp`, the first build prints `GLOB mismatch!` and
  stops — just rerun once.

## Layout

- `core/` — the engine. `src/` by subsystem: `regarima/ automdl/ x11/ seats/
  outlier/ transform/ specparse/ diag/ force/ numeric/ tables/ driver/ common/`.
  `driver/run_*.cpp` are the phase harnesses (`x13run_m2/m3/x11/iddiff`).
- `oracle/fortran/` — the Census Fortran **oracle** (the source of truth) + its
  prebuilt `_O2`/`_O0` binaries.
- `tests/` — `corpus/` (specs), `golden/` (blessed oracle output), `parity/`
  (pytest M-gates), `unit/` (ctest).
- `tools/` — `worklog.py` (dev timeline), `*_scouting.md` (port plans),
  `census_bugs.md`, `FABLE_REVIEW.md`, `TEST_COVERAGE.md`, build/coverage scripts.
- `r-pkg/`, `py-pkg/` — language wrappers.

## Progress & commits

- **Track dev time** via `tools/worklog.py`; this is a PoC, so lead progress
  reports with elapsed active time. `WORKLOG.md` is a periodic snapshot; the git
  timeline is authoritative.
- Commit style: `M<n>/<subsystem>: <what>`, list the gated specs, end with the
  `Co-Authored-By:` + `Claude-Session:` trailers.

## Current phase — M5 (X-11 / SEATS)

M0–M4 done (parse, regARIMA estimate/forecast, automatic model ID). M5 in
progress: X-11 decomposition spine (B1→D16) is bit-exact on the no-model and
regressor-free automdl paths. **SEATS seasonal decomposition corpus is now
fully bit-exact** — every SEATS corpus spec's s10–s18 tables gate (~5e-15),
including the near-non-invertible fixed-airline variants (payems_fixed /
expgs_fixed, closed via a faithful CALCFX forecast-residual port in
`core/src/seats/estbur.cpp`). **slidingspans{} is also now bit-exact** (all
4 spans, sfs+chs; the per-span `xtrm.ksdev` reset fix in `run_x11_span`).
Remaining diagnostics front: history{} (reuses the re-entrant span driver).
- **Open:** the `*-aictest-x11` / `*-fixed-airline-x11` specs are xfailed. The
  aictest selection IS now wired into `automd` (gated `do_aictest`; block-1
  tdaic/easaic + a0/ismd0 revert), so on `airline` the correct model (td1coef +
  Easter) reaches X-11 with nonzero factors. The remaining blocker is **x11pt2's
  model-based factor combine** (`x11pt2.f:74-352`, unported — fatals at
  `x11parts.cpp:275` before any table emits). Port that + wire regeff's ftd/fhol
  into `ctx.x11fac` to un-xfail airline. Full nloop/tstmd1 still needed for the
  non-default-model series. See **`tools/x11_regeff_handoff.md`** (session update).
